# NoGeese

**NoGeese** is a simple Ruby gem that reassures you there are no geese in your Rails application. It displays a comforting message whenever a model is accessed or an ActiveRecord operation is performed.

Disclaimer: NoGeese does not actually do anything to prevent goose infiltration.

**Don't let this happen to you.**
